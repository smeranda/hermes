                            Hello CONTACT.PREFERRED_NAME ,
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            As I write to you, the campus has calmed greatly.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It’s a strange dichotomy to have a campus that exists for the sole purpose of equipping men and women for a future of service be largely empty, save for the faculty and staff preparing for a new year to do just that. What makes the contrast even more dramatic is that the Concordia community is now descending off the mountaintop weekend of commencement and the Golden Reunion for the Class of 1965.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The 90 classmates and guests of the Class of 1965 came together, some after 50 years apart, to this place and enjoyed looking back on a time of fond memories with great joy (see attendees and reunion details here). We are thankful that through their experience, the classmates decided to endow a $50,000 scholarship. This scholarship will certainly become a great blessing to future students for generations to come. Thank you, members of the Class of 1965—you have blessed our alma mater in many ways!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We also celebrated 563 graduates earning master’s or bachelor’s degrees this year. These students are incredible alumni, ready to answer God’s call to learn, serve and lead in the church and world. I invite you to view the Class of 2015 video and hear our graduates reflect on their experiences at Concordia in their own words.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Concordia University, Nebraska is so richly blessed.
